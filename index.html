            <h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
                <p>Lenka and I spent a relatively short time working together. However, even in a few months she has shown me that she is a star (a superstar according to Kim Scott) that everyone wants to have on their team. She enjoys automating tasks, and is not afraid to learn new systems to make the most of them in her daily work. She is happy to share the knowledge she's gained with others and help them get set up. She is not afraid to bring new ideas to joint meetings that could enrich the work. She is open-minded and always says what she thinks. Honest feedback is one of the things that can push working relationships further and I have always valued that. She will constantly need new stimuli and opportunities to learn in order to stay motivated and develop.</p> 
                <p>If the situation comes up and Lenka is sitting in front of you applying for a position in your company, definitely don't let her walk away. Enjoy working with her and be a good leader who can develop her potential. Lenka will repay you with her zest for work, her ability to take responsibility and her great loyalty.</p>
